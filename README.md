This project focuses on predicting methane gas emissions from rice cultivation using real-world agricultural and environmental datasets sourced from FAOSTAT. The goal is to analyze the key drivers of methane emissions and support climate-smart agriculture strategies through data-driven insights.

🚀 Project Overview

Developed a machine learning model to forecast methane emissions based on agricultural production data.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand emission patterns across years and regions.

Identified the major contributing factors impacting methane emissions using feature selection techniques.

Built a prediction system to assist researchers and policymakers in sustainable agriculture decision-making.

🔍 Methodology

1. Dataset Import & Cleaning : Handling missing values , Converting units and fixing formatting

2. Exploratory Data Analysis : Trend visualization across years and countries , Correlation analysis among agricultural features

3. Feature Engineering: Selection of top emission drivers , Scaling / encoding where necessary

4.Model Building & Evaluation: Model training, validation, and comparison , Performance metrics: R², RMSE or Accuracy.

5.Prediction : Model predicts methane emissions for given agricultural input variables

📊 Key Insights:

Methane emissions show a positive correlation with rice harvested area & paddy production volume.

Top contributing factors include crop yield, fertilizer usage, water systems, and livestock presence (if applicable).

Ensemble models produced better generalization than traditional linear models.
